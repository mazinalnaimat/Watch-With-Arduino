We create digital watch by using arduino, lcd and rtc.

there code for arduino ide and for platformio


you can build it as hardware or simulate it by tincker cad or pretues 

in the first using functional programming then using [OOP programming(soon)] 

this project is created for learn and apply programming skills



you can try that in tinkercad simulation: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0I0BCOHZ7Lf-digital-watch-by-lcd16x2
